### Join. Chat. Leave. No Records.

## Features of the App:
#### 1. Multiple users can connect to the same room and chat.
#### 2. The app is based on Snapchat as when you leave the room the messages automatically get deleted.
#### 3. The app allows you to send text messages and emojis ;)
#### 4. No duplicate users can join the same room which means no two users with the same name can join the same room.
#### 5. Multiple rooms can function simultaneously.
#### 6. The app is purely based on JS so none of your chat data is saved anywhere. User privacy is important.
